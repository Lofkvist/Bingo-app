# Bingo-app

This is my first full-stack web application, where users complete tasks in real life and then mark them as Done in the app. It is built with the MERN stackâ€”MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
The project was primarily intended as a personal challenge and as a tool for my family. A simple authentication system was implemented using JSON Web Tokens. However, the application will not be deployed, as it lacks essential security features such as encrypted password storage.
The UI includes only the basic functionality necessary for the application to run.
