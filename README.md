# Bingo-app

An application where users proceed by completing tasks in real life and marking them as 'Done' in the app.
This is my first full stack web application, which uses the MERN tech stack, meaning MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js.
The intention was to challenge myself, and to have a website which could be used by my family. A simple authentication system is
implemented using JSON Web Tokens. It's main purpose was to act as a challenge for be, and will never be deployed, partly because
the application lacks security must-haves such as encrypted password storage. The UI features the bare necessities for the application
to run
